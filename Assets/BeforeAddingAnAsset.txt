There is some things to concider when adding an asset.
Assimp is a bit picky when reading in everything, especially .obj with .mtl...

---- OBJ & MTL ----

Models:
	Check the path for the material. Has to be relative to the .obj-file
	Example: "mtllib ../Materials/myMaterial.mtl"

Materials with PBR:
	Albedo: 		"map_Kd   example_Albedo.png"
	Normalmap:		"map_Kn   example_Normal.png"
	Metalness:		"map_ns   example_Metalness.png"
	Roughness:		"map_Ks   example_Roughness.png"
	Ambient occlusion: 	"map_Ka   example_AO.png"
	Displacement:		"map_disp example_Displace.png"
	Opacitymask		"map_d    example_Opacity.png"	(feature is not up on master yet)

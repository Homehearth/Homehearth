## General info
This project has been developed using Visual Studio 2019.
It is mainly written in C++ and currently uses the DirectX 11 API for rendering. Whilst still in the early stages, it will one day change the way we look at game engine architecture and expand across all platorms known to mankind. It will feature an absolute non-latency, lagfree multiplayer networking system built from scratch using a completely new relationary multi-threaded system. Feel free to browse the Git repository and try this out for yourself.
